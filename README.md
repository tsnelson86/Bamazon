# Bamazon

## BamazonCustomer.js
There is only one main function to this program: to allow users to purchase items from the store. The users will be asked which item they want to purchase, and how many of that item they want to buy. If there are enough items in stock the user will be able to complete the purchase and will be told their total. If there are not enough items in stock the user will be told so.

## BamazonManager.js
This program has many more functions for the managers of the store. These include:
 * Viewing List of Products
 * Viewing Products with Low Inventory Levels
 * Adding New Products
 * Increasing the Quantity of Products

The managers are able to switch between menus as they are always brought back to the beginning of the process after a previous action. Everytime the menu loads the database is updated locally as well as on the SQL server. 

## Video of files in action has been attached to the assignment.
